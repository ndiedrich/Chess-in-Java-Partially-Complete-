# Chess

(Not complete)
The program is chess using standard java synthax and AWT containers. 
You move a piece by clicking the piece to move, and then the space to move to. 
White goes first. 

Does it work? Yeah. Except for: 
- Pawns don't have all the move logic done. 
- Castling doesn't currently work
- There isn't an end condition yet. 

I'll update this soon.
